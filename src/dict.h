/**
 * @page howtoContextDict Context Dictionary
 *
 * Context includes dictionary to store strings more effectively. The most of strings repeats quite often in schema
 * as well as data trees. Therefore, instead of allocating those strings each time they appear, libyang stores them
 * as records in the dictionary. The basic API to the context dictionary is public, so even a caller application can
 * use the dictionary.
 *
 * To insert a string into the dictionary, caller can use ::lydict_insert() (adding a constant string) or
 * ::lydict_insert_zc() (for dynamically allocated strings that won't be used by the caller after its insertion into
 * the dictionary). Both functions provide the pointer to the inserted string in the dictionary record.
 *
 * To remove (reference of the) string from the context dictionary, ::lydict_remove() is supposed to be used.
 *
 * \note Incorrect usage of the dictionary can break libyang functionality.
 *
 * \note API for this group of functions is described in the [Dictionary module](@ref dict).
 *
 * Functions List
 * --------------
 * - ::lydict_insert()
 * - ::lydict_insert_zc()
 * - ::lydict_remove()
