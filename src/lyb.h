/**
 * LYB format
 *
 * Unlike XML or JSON, it is binary format so most data are represented in similar way but in binary.
 * Some notable differences:
 *
 * - schema nodes are identified based on their hash instead of their string name. In case of collisions
 * an array of hashes is created with each next hash one bit shorter until a unique sequence of all these
 * hashes is found and then all of them are stored.
 *
 * - tree structure is represented as individual strictly bounded subtrees. Each subtree begins
 * with its metadata, which consist of 1) the whole subtree length in bytes and 2) number
 * of included metadata chunks of nested subtrees.
 *
 * - since length of a subtree is not known before it is printed, holes are first written and
 * after the subtree is printed, they are filled with actual valid metadata. As a consequence,
 * LYB data cannot be directly printed into streams!
 *
 * - data are preceded with information about all the used modules. It is needed because of
 * possible augments and deviations which must be known beforehand, otherwise schema hashes
 * could be matched to the wrong nodes.
