 * Various options to change the data tree parsers behavior.
 *
 * Default parser behavior:
 * - complete input file is always parsed. In case of XML, even not well-formed XML document (multiple top-level
 * elements) is parsed in its entirety,
 * - parser silently ignores data without matching schema node definition,
 * - list instances are checked whether they have all the keys, error is raised if not.
 *
 * Default parser validation behavior:
 * - the provided data are expected to provide complete datastore content (both the configuration and state data)
 * and performs data validation according to all YANG rules, specifics follow,
 * - list instances are expected to have all the keys (it is not checked),
 * - instantiated (status) obsolete data print a warning,
 * - all types are fully resolved (leafref/instance-identifier targets, unions) and must be valid (lists have
 * all the keys, leaf(-lists) correct values),
 * - when statements on existing nodes are evaluated, if not satisfied, a validation error is raised,
 * - if-feature statements are evaluated,
 * - invalid multiple data instances/data from several cases cause a validation error,
 * - implicit nodes (NP containers and default values) are added.
