 *
 * Order of the resulting set follows these rules:
 * - To change the first tree into the second tree, the resulting transactions are supposed to be applied in the order
 *   they appear in the result. First, the changed (#LYD_DIFF_CHANGED) nodes are described followed by the deleted
 *   (#LYD_DIFF_DELETED) nodes. Then, the moving of the user-ordered nodes present in both trees (#LYD_DIFF_MOVEDAFTER1)
 *   follows and the last transactions in the results are the newly created (#LYD_DIFF_CREATED) nodes. These nodes are
 *   supposed to be added as the last siblings, but in some case they can need additional move. In such a case, the
 *   #LYD_DIFF_MOVEDAFTER2 transactions can appear.
 * - The order of the changed (#LYD_DIFF_CHANGED) and created (#LYD_DIFF_CREATED) follows the nodes order in the
 *   second tree - the current siblings are processed first and then the children are processed. Note, that this is
 *   actually not the BFS:

 *         3   4 7   8
 *        / \
 *       5   6
 *
 * - The order of the deleted (#LYD_DIFF_DELETED) nodes is the DFS:
 *
 *           1     6
 *          / \   / \
 *         2   5 7   8
 *        / \
 *       3   4
 *
 * To change the first tree into the second one, it is necessary to follow the order of transactions described in
 * the result. Note, that it is not possible just to use the transactions in the reverse order to transform the

 * @param[in] second The second (sub)tree to compare. Without #LYD_OPT_NOSIBLINGS option, all siblings are

 *
 * Various options to change the data tree parsers behavior.
 *
 * Default behavior:
 * - in case of XML, parser reads all data from its input (file, memory, XML tree) including the case of not well-formed
 * XML document (multiple top-level elements) and if there is an unknown element, it is skipped including its subtree
 * (see the next point). This can be changed by the #LYD_OPT_NOSIBLINGS option which make parser to read only a single
 * tree (with a single root element) from its input.
 * - parser silently ignores the data without a matching node in schema trees. If the caller want to stop
 * parsing in case of presence of unknown data, the #LYD_OPT_STRICT can be used. The strict mode is useful for
 * NETCONF servers, since NETCONF clients should always send data according to the capabilities announced by the server.
 * On the other hand, the default non-strict mode is useful for clients receiving data from NETCONF server since
 * clients are not required to understand everything the server does. Of course, the optimal strategy for clients is
 * to use filtering to get only the required data. Having an unknown element of the known namespace is always an error.
 * The behavior can be changed by #LYD_OPT_STRICT option.
 * - using obsolete statements (status set to obsolete) just generates a warning, but the processing continues. The
 * behavior can be changed by #LYD_OPT_OBSOLETE option.
 * - parser expects that the provided data provides complete datastore content (both the configuration and state data)
 * and performs data validation according to all YANG rules. This can be a problem in case of representing NETCONF's
 * subtree filter data, edit-config's data or other type of data set - such data do not represent a complete data set
 * and some of the validation rules can fail. Therefore there are other options (within lower 8 bits) to make parser
 * to accept such a data.
 * - when parser evaluates when-stmt condition to false, a validation error is raised. If the
 * #LYD_OPT_WHENAUTODEL is used, the invalid node is silently removed instead of an error. The option (and also this default
 * behavior) takes effect only in case of #LYD_OPT_DATA or #LYD_OPT_CONFIG type of data.
